## Project 4: Web optimization and performance improvement

Following are the files to optimize. 
1. index.html (renamed index_org.html, as you need index.html as the default file to run the server and run Google page insights using ngrok)
2. project-2048.html
4. project-mobile.html
5. project-webperf.html

The new optimized files 
1. index-main.html
2. index-project-2048.html
3. index-project-mobile.html
4. index-project-webperf.html 

The goal is 90+ score on Google Insights page for both mobile and web.
To run server, use python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080 and ngrok 8080.
To use them, you need python as well as ngrok installed.
Then go to Google speed insights to test performance.

Also, download Gulp to automate minifying the css and js files. To minify
image files, I used online tools (I did that prior to testing Gulp). The sites
I used http://jpeg-optimizer.com/ and http://compresspng.com/.

Gulp can be downloaded at http://gulpjs.com/. Instructions are easy to follow.

I included comments in each file to show what was modified to improve perfomance.


## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
